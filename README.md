# 3 component seismic polarization analysis

Matt Haney wrote two polarization analysis codes. The first is based on the __covariance__ method. The second is based on the __coherency__ method from [this](http://www.bssaonline.org/content/76/5/1393.abstract) paper.

Run the poliriz.m file to see a comparison of the two methods using a syntethic input.
